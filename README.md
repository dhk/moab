MOAB (Mother of All Bombs): An exercise in Storytelling With Data
This is an exercise in putting context around information. 

What *does* a 1,000 Yard Blast Radius look like? Or a 2-mile zone of damage? 

Technologies used in this visualization:
* MapBox and Leaflet, for Mapping and Control
* jQuery and jQuery UI for logic
* SSL to enable geocoding (for address lookup)
* OpenStreetMap (for geocoding)
